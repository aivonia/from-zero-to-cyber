# 🚧 Are Cybersecurity Bootcamps Worth It?

Bootcamps are a fast-track option into cybersecurity — but they’re not all built the same. Here’s an honest look at what they offer, what to watch out for, and which ones are worth your time.

---

## ✅ When Bootcamps Are Worth It
- You walk away with **a certification (Security+, CySA+, AWS, etc.)**
- You complete **real-world labs or projects** that you can showcase
- The program includes **career support**, resume help, or mentoring
- The price is reasonable and not predatory (no $20K+ for basic cert prep!)

---

## 🚩 When Bootcamps Might Be a Waste
- No certification or proof of learning
- Just slides and videos — no hands-on labs or roleplay
- Big price tag with minimal access to instructors
- Unrealistic promises ("guaranteed job in 12 weeks")

---

## 💡 Recommended Bootcamps (for cert + value)
- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** (Coursera) – Entry-level, hands-on
- **CompTIA CertMaster Learn + Labs** – Direct training from the cert source
- **TCM Security Academy** – Affordable, practical pentest & blue team training
- **Level Effect Cyber Defense Cert** – SOC-focused, includes labs and job prep
- **SANS Foundations / SANS CyberStart** – Pricey but extremely reputable

## 🔍 Alternatives to Bootcamps
- TryHackMe learning paths (Blue, Red, Pre-Security)
- ITProTV / INE / StationX
- LinkedIn Learning (if you already have access)
- Self-paced cert courses with lab vouchers

## 🧠 Final Advice
> Don’t pay for a bootcamp unless it offers **certification, hands-on training, and support**.

If you're tight on money or just exploring cyber, start with self-paced cert training and see what sticks — then level up from there.
