### 2. **Ingest Data**
- Use built-in sample data from Splunk, or upload logs manually:

  - Sysmon logs
- Optional: Forward logs from a virtual machine using Universal Forwarder

### 3. **Understand Splunk Search Basics**
- Learn the structure of Splunk queries:
  ```spl
  index=main sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4625
  ```
- Use commands like:
  - `stats`
  - `timechart`
  - `eval`
  - `rex` (for regex parsing)

### 4. **Build Custom Dashboards**
- Create a dashboard to monitor:
  - Failed logins
  - PowerShell usage
  - New user account creation
- Use charts, tables, and single-value panels

### 5. **Use the MITRE ATT&CK Framework in Splunk**
- Match alerts/logs with techniques like:
  - T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)
  - T1078 (Valid Accounts)
- Try adding MITRE mapping as tags or descriptions in dashboards

### 📈 **Project 2: PowerShell Activity Tracker**
- Ingest logs from a VM
- Track PowerShell command lines via Event ID 4104
- Highlight suspicious encodings or downloads

### 📑 **Project 3: SOC Analyst Mini Report**
