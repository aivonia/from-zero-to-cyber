# 🧨 Penetration Tester (Ethical Hacker) Pathway

A **Penetration Tester** (or ethical hacker) simulates cyberattacks to find and fix vulnerabilities before real attackers can exploit them. This is one of the most well-known red team roles and often blends technical skill with creativity and curiosity.

If you love breaking things to understand how they work — and then helping secure them — this role might be for you.
